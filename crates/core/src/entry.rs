//! The `LogEntry` type — a single parsed log line.
//!
//! This is the canonical in-memory representation used by every layer of
//! logdive: the parser produces `LogEntry` values, the indexer consumes them,
//! and the executor returns them from queries.
//!
//! Field layout follows the hybrid storage decision in the project doc
//! (decisions log, 2026-04-19): the four "known" fields (`timestamp`, `level`,
//! `message`, `tag`) are first-class members that map to indexed SQLite
//! columns, while everything else lives in the `fields` map and is persisted
//! as a JSON blob queried via `json_extract()`.
