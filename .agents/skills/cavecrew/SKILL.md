description: >
  Decision guide for delegating to caveman-style subagents. Tells the main
  thread WHEN to spawn `cavecrew-investigator` (locate code), `cavecrew-builder`
  (1-2 file edit), or `cavecrew-reviewer` (diff review) instead of doing the
  work inline or using vanilla `Explore`. Subagent output is caveman-compressed
  so the tool-result injected back into main context is ~60% smaller — main
  context lasts longer across long sessions.
  Trigger: "delegate to subagent", "use cavecrew", "spawn investigator/builder/reviewer",
  "save context", "compressed agent output".

Cavecrew = three subagent presets that emit caveman output. Same job as Anthropic defaults (`Explore`, edit-style agents, reviewer); difference is the tool-result they return is compressed, so main context shrinks per delegation.

## When to use cavecrew vs alternatives

| Task | Use |
|---|---|
| "Where is X defined / what calls Y / list uses of Z" | `cavecrew-investigator` |
| Same but you also want suggestions/architecture commentary | `Explore` (vanilla) |
| Surgical edit, ≤2 files, scope obvious | `cavecrew-builder` |
| New feature / 3+ files / cross-cutting refactor | Main thread or `feature-dev:code-architect` |
| Review diff, branch, or file for bugs | `cavecrew-reviewer` |
| Deep code review with rationale + alternatives | `Code Reviewer` (vanilla) |
| One-line answer you already know | Main thread, no subagent |
