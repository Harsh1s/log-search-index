# CLAUDE.md — Working with logdive

This file orients Claude Code (and any AI assistant) before touching the codebase.
Read this first. The rules here override any defaults.

## What this project is

logdive is a fast, self-hosted query engine for structured logs. Three-crate
Rust workspace (edition 2024, MSRV 1.85). Ships two binaries:

- `logdive` — CLI: ingest, query, stats, prune.
- `logdive-api` — read-only HTTP server: GET /query, /stats, /version.

Library half: `logdive-core` is publishable as a standalone crate.

Current version: **0.3.0** (released 2026-06-05).
Next milestone: **0.4.0** (yaml/csv output, configurable retention by source, Windows --follow).

## Commands

```bash
# Compile checkpoint — run after every meaningful change
cargo build --workspace
cargo test --workspace --no-fail-fast
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --all --check

# Run binaries
cargo run --bin logdive -- --help
cargo run --bin logdive-api -- --help

# Benchmarks
cargo bench   # reports in target/criterion/

# Pre-release verification (full battery)
./scripts/prerelease-check.sh
```

## Crate layout

```
crates/
  core/   — logdive-core: library (LogEntry, parsers, Indexer, query, executor, FileTailer)
  cli/    — logdive: binary (subcommands: ingest, query, stats, prune)
  api/    — logdive-api: binary (axum router, AppState, handlers)
```

CLI's crate path is `crates/cli/` but the **binary name and crate name are both `logdive`**. Never call it `cli`.

## Locked architecture decisions (do not revisit)

- SQLite via `rusqlite` (bundled feature). No separate DB process.
- Hybrid schema: `timestamp`, `level`, `message`, `tag` as indexed columns; everything else in a `fields TEXT` JSON blob queried via `json_extract()`.
- Hand-written recursive descent query parser. No parser-combinator libs.
- blake3 row hashing → `INSERT OR IGNORE` on `raw_hash UNIQUE`.
- 1000 rows per insert transaction.
- CLI is fully synchronous (no tokio). Only the API uses tokio.
- API opens DB with `SQLITE_OPEN_READ_ONLY`. Fresh connection per request via `AppState::with_connection` → `spawn_blocking`.
- `--follow` is Unix-only (uses `(dev, ino)` rotation detection from `std::os::unix::fs::MetadataExt`). Windows --follow is v0.4+.
- Query language v0.3: AND + OR + parenthesised groups via `Clause::Group(Box<QueryNode>)`. Full grammar in `.context/architecture.md`.
- Formats: JSON (default), logfmt, plain. Dispatcher in `parsers::mod`.
- CORS disabled by default. GET-only when enabled. No credentials.
- HTTP API has no authentication. Read-only is the defence-in-depth answer; deployment is responsible for putting auth in front.

## Git workflow

- Integration branch per milestone series: e.g. `release/v0.3.0`.
- One PR per milestone, squash-merged from `feat/v0.3.0/<slug>` or `chore/v0.3.0/<slug>` branches.
- One final merge-commit PR `release/vX.Y.Z` → `main` ships the version.
- Force-push with `--force-with-lease` only.
- Conventional Commits format.

## Operating rules

These override any default behaviour. Honor every one.

1. **Plan before any non-trivial code.** Write a plan, get explicit approval, then execute milestone-by-milestone.
2. **Full files only.** Never deliver diffs. Edit by writing the new full file.
3. **Zero placeholders or TODOs.** If you can't finish something, surface the blocker; don't write `// TODO`.
4. **One patch per error report.** Fix what was reported; surface other findings separately.
5. **Don't invent scope.** If the user didn't ask, don't add it.
6. **Flag design decisions upfront.** List options, recommend one with justification, get approval, then write code.
7. **Compile checkpoint** after every meaningful change. Zero warnings on clippy. Zero diff on fmt --check.
8. **Conventional Commits.**
9. **Web-search before stating present-day facts** (versions, API shapes, GHA syntax). Don't guess from training data.
10. **`cargo clean`** if stale-cache symptoms appear.
11. **Honor MSRV 1.85.** Don't use features from later editions.
12. **Use the right binary name.** CLI is `logdive`. Not `cli`.

## File-creation policy

If the user gives a path explicitly, use it. Otherwise:

- New core modules → `crates/core/src/<name>.rs` and export from `lib.rs`.
